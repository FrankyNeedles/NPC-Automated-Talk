Project Vision: The Living Broadcast Network
The Core Concept
To create the first fully autonomous, persistent, and interactive television network inside Horizon Worlds.
This is not a simple chatbot loop. It is a simulation of a professional broadcast studio, run by a hierarchy of specialized AI agents who plan, direct, schedule, and perform a 24/7 show that adapts to the time of day, the energy of the room, and the creative input of the audience.
1. The Player Experience
From the perspective of a visitor entering the world.
The Arrival (Immersion)
When a player joins, they don't see NPCs waiting for someone to click them. They walk into a live broadcast in progress.
The Atmosphere: The "ON AIR" light is glowing red. Two hosts (Anchor & Co-Host) are mid-conversation, debating a news headline or laughing about a viral trend.
The Pacing: The dialogue is snappy. There are no awkward robotic pauses. They interrupt each other naturally. They don't just read lines; they have opinions.
The Context: If the room is crowded and chaotic, the hosts are energetic and loud. If it's 3:00 AM and the room is empty, they are having a relaxed, deep-dive philosophical discussion.
The Interaction (The "Lobby" Game)
The player isn't just a passive viewer; they are a potential producer.
The Concierge: In the lobby, they meet Jamie (The Audience Coordinator). Jamie isn't a broadcaster; they are a friend. They recognize "Regulars" ("Hey Franky, back again?") and welcome new guests.
The Pitch: The player chats with Jamie. "I think you guys should talk about Mars." Jamie uses AI to workshop the idea: "Mars is cool, but what's the hook? Aliens? Elon?"
The Submission: Once refined, the player submits the pitch.
The Payoff (Agency)
The Decision: Moments later, a notification appears. The hidden Executive Producer has reviewed the pitch against the network's standards and schedule.
The Big Board: The studio monitor updates.
NOW PLAYING: Tech News
UP NEXT: Viewer Request - Mars Colony (By Franky)
The Reward: The current segment ends. The transition music plays. The Hosts come back on air: "Welcome back. We have a special request from a viewer in the lobby..." The player sees their idea come to life in real-time.
2. The Scene Creator Experience
From the perspective of a world builder using this system.
Plug-and-Play Production
The creator is not writing code; they are staffing a station.
Deployment: The creator drops the Broadcast_System cube into the scene, hides the Director NPC under the floor, and places the two Host NPCs at a desk.
Customization: They don't touch scripts. They use Inspector Slots.
Want a serious news network? Set the Anchor's role to "Serious Journalist" and the Co-Host to "Political Pundit."
Want a comedy show? Set the roles to "Comedian" and "Heckler."
Want faster pacing? Slide the "Turn Delay" down.
Content Control
The creator controls the narrative through the Topics Database.
They fill the database with the lore of their specific world, real-world news, or fictional drama.
The system handles the rest: rotating topics, preventing repetition, and finding creative angles.
Reliability (Zero Dead Air)
The creator never has to worry about the show breaking.
If the AI service goes down, the system seamlessly switches to Logic Mode, using pre-written banter and fallback lines.
If a player leaves, the memory handles it.
The show runs infinitely, 24/7, with no maintenance required.
3. The Technical Philosophy
How the magic happens under the hood.
Hierarchical AI: We don't ask one AI to do everything.
Executive Producer: Strategic logic (Scheduling, Approving).
Station Director: Creative logic (Writing scripts, Stage Directions).
Show Scheduler: Traffic control (Timing, Turn-taking).
Talent: Performance (Acting, Speaking).
Vortex Math: The show follows a deterministic energy cycle (1-2-4-8-7-5) so the pacing creates a natural emotional journey (Intro -> High Energy -> Deep Dive -> Cool Down) rather than random noise.
Hybrid Pipeline: We prioritize Speed over Smarts. We execute the show using fast code logic while generating the next segment's AI script in the background. This ensures there is never a pause while the bot "thinks."
Summary
This project transforms NPCs from "Vending Machines" (push button, get text) into "Living Actors" who inhabit a world that exists whether the player is there or not. It turns a Horizon World into a living media entity.
